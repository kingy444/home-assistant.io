The Litter-Robot integration allows you to control and monitor your Wi-Fi-enabled, automatic, self-cleaning litter box for cats.

You will need a Litter-Robot account as well as a Wi-Fi-enabled Litter-Robot unit that has already been associated with your account.

The Feeder-Robot and Litter-Robot 4 are not currently supported by this integration.

## Services

Services are utilized for additional functionality that is available in the Litter-Robot companion app. The following are currently available:

### set_sleep_mode

Enables (with `start_time` parameter) or disables sleep mode on the Litter-Robot.

| Parameter  | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| enabled    | bool   | yes      | Set to true to enable and false to disable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| start_time | string | no       | Time at which the unit will enter sleep mode and prevent an automatic clean cycle for 8 hours. This param uses the 24-hour format string `%H:%M:%S`, with seconds being optional, and is based on the timezone configured for your Home Assistant installation. As such, `10:30:00` would indicate 10:30 AM, whereas `22:30:00` would indicate 10:30 PM. |

Example of setting the sleep mode to begin at 10:30 PM.

```yaml
service: litterrobot.set_sleep_mode
target:
  entity_id: vacuum.litter_robot_litter_box
data:
  enabled: true
  start_time: "22:30:00"

```
