The Thread integration helps you track the different Thread networks in your home and store the Thread network credentials (similar to a Wi-Fi password). The Thread integration in Home Assistant is currently still a work in progress.

You do not need to install this integration. The Thread integration shows up automatically when Home Assistant detects a [border router](#about-thread-border-routers).

## Logos on Thread-based smart home devices

If you have a Thread-based consumer device, you will typically see a Thread logo on the packaging.

<p class='img'><img width="200" src='/images/integrations/thread/thread-requires-border-router.png'></p>

The "Built on Thread: requires border router" logo means Thread is the only supported network protocol for this device. You cannot use Wi-Fi to communicate with this device.

In addition, you will see a {% term Matter %} or Apple HomeKit logo on the packaging.

{% term Matter %} and Apple HomeKit are smart home protocols. They are responsible for handling the Thread credentials and connecting your Thread device to the Thread network. A smart home protocol is needed to control your device. Both home automation standards are supported natively by Home Assistant.

## Adding a Thread-based device to Home Assistant

How a Thread-based device is added to Home Assistant depends on the home automation standard it uses.

1. If you see the {% term Matter %} logo on your device packaging, follow the procedure [adding a Matter device to Home Assistant](/integrations/matter/#adding-a-matter-device-to-home-assistant).

## About Thread

This section introduces the terms *Thread* and *border router* and lists border routers that are supported by Home Assistant.

### A communication protocol for IoT devices

Thread is a low-power mesh networking standard for IoT devices. The low-power aspect is important for battery-powered smart home devices. However, it's also low-bandwidth, making it ideal for applications that don't send a lot of data, like switches or motion sensors.

Thread uses the same <abbr title="radio frequency">RF</abbr> technology as Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4) but provides IP connectivity similar to Wi-Fi. Unlike Zigbee, Thread by itself does not allow controlling devices: It is just a communication protocol. To control the Thread devices, a higher-level protocol is required: {% term Matter %} or Apple HomeKit. Thread devices use the IPv6 standard to communicate both inside and outside the mesh network.

### About Thread border routers

The devices use Thread border routers to communicate outside the mesh with any IPv6-capable device. A Thread border router is connected to your network either via Wi-Fi or Ethernet and uses its <abbr title="radio frequency">RF</abbr> radio to communicate with the Thread mesh network. The <abbr title="Thread border router">TBR</abbr> routes packets between your local network and the Thread mesh. It does not look at the content of these packets, it just forwards them.

Image taken from [the Thread Smart Home Fact Sheet](https://www.threadgroup.org/support#Resources) by the Thread Group. It illustrates the landscape of {% term Matter %}, {% term Thread %}, and Border routers. Instead of Matter, you could also see another protocol here, such as HomeKit.

Unlike other protocols, Thread can use multiple border routers in a single network. This increases wireless coverage and reduces the risk of a single point of failure. Ideal for home automation, with a potentially large number of devices spread over a large area.

#### OpenThread border routers

OpenThread is an open source implementation of Thread, originally released by Google. Almost all commercially available Thread border routers are based on the open source implementation. However, the configuration of <abbr title="Thread border routers">TBRs</abbr> is not part of the Thread standard. This means that Google and Apple <abbr title="Thread border routers">TBRs</abbr> implementation setup and configured by their respective ecosystems.

While Home Assistant can *use* any border router, it can *configure* and *control* only OpenThread border routers built with the REST API available in the open source implementation. The OpenThread Border Router add-on (as well as the OpenThread Border Router bundled in the experimental Silicon Labs Multiprotocol add-on) are built from this open source OpenThread code and have the REST API enabled.

### List of Thread border router devices

Often, Thread border routing is only an auxiliary functionality of a smart home device. For example, the Nest Hub (2nd gen) is a smart display, a Google Home controller, and a Chromecast target, but also has a Thread border router included.

Currently, the following <abbr title="Thread border router">TBR</abbr> devices are known to work with Home Assistant.
These border routers may require an iPhone or Android phone for onboarding. What the exact requirements are, depends on the home automation protocol ({% term Matter %} or Apple HomeKit) that your devices are using. Before buying a border router, check the prerequisites in the corresponding procedures:

- [Adding a Matter device to Home Assistant](/integrations/matter/#adding-a-matter-device-to-home-assistant)
- [Adding an Apple HomeKit device through Thread](/integrations/homekit_controller/#adding-a-homekit-device-through-thread)

#### Home Assistant

The Thread support on these devices is in experimental state. Out of the box, they run Zigbee, not Thread.

- [Home Assistant SkyConnect](/skyconnect/) USB stick. Follow this procedure to [enable Thread on SkyConnect](https://skyconnect.home-assistant.io/procedures/enable-thread/).

#### Google

- **Displays**: Nest Hub (2nd gen), Nest Hub Max
- **Wi-Fi routers**: Nest Wifi Pro (Wi-Fi 6E), Nest Wifi

#### Apple

- **Speakers**: HomePod (2nd generation), HomePod mini
- **TVs**: Apple TV 4K (3rd generation) Wi-Fi + Ethernet, Apple TV 4K (2nd generation)

#### Others

There are also other companies that provide devices with border router capability, such as Nanoleaf or Amazon.

## Understanding the Thread configuration page

This section explains why you might see multiple networks on the Thread configuration page and what this means for your network.

### About different Thread networks

Today, each vendor forms their own Thread network when you start using their products. This means you can end up having a Home Assistant, an Apple, and a Google Thread network in your home. The Thread configuration panel lists all Thread border routers and groups them by the Thread network.

<p class='img'><img width="400" src='/images/integrations/thread/thread-no-3rd-party-credentials.png'>
The Thread configuration page shows three vendor-specific Thread networks.
</p>

These are all separate networks using different credentials. This means devices can't roam between the Thread networks.

The <img width="30px" src='/images/integrations/thread/information-outline.png'> icon indicates that Home Assistant has the credentials for that network. In this case, only the credentials of the `home assistant` network are known.

Home Assistant discovers all Thread border routers in your network because they send mDNS/DNS-SD announcements. These local announcements don't contain the network credentials. That's why you see the network there, but not the credentials.

#### About the preferred network

The intention of the **Preferred network** in Home Assistant is that it will be used as the default network when adding Thread‚Åªbased devices.

<div class="note">

The **preferred network** function isn't completely implemented yet. In particular, when adding {% term Matter %} devices through the companion apps, the preferred network of the mobile device is being used.

</div>

#### Making a network your preferred network

You can only set a Thread network as preferred if the credentials are known.

1. To import Thread credentials, you need your Android and iOS companion app.
2. On your companion app, navigate to the Thread configuration page.
   - You should see an **Import credentials** button in the lower right corner.

   <img width="400" src='/images/integrations/thread/thread-import-credentials.png'>

   - Importing the credentials allows a Google- or Apple-created Thread network to be the preferred network of Home Assistant.
   <img width="400" src='/images/integrations/thread/thread-preferred-network.png'>

#### Using Home Assistant as a <abbr title="Thread border router">TBR</abbr> without setting up another vendor's TBR first

This scenario currently only works in one particular case, under the following conditions:

- Make sure there are no other Thread networks set up:
  - For example: Make sure you do not have any Google <abbr title="Thread border routers">TBRs</abbr> set up yet (otherwise the Google <abbr title="Thread border router">TBR</abbr> will be the preferred Thread network, and Android APIs do not allow to change that currently).
- You have the OpenThread Border Router add-on installed. If you have the experimental Silicon Labs Multiprotocol add-on installed, we recommend migrating to the pure Thread firmware, as especially Thread traffic appears to cause stability issues. For instructions on how to enable/migrate to a dedicated Thread setup on SkyConnect or Yellow, refer to the following guides:
  - [Enabling Thread on SkyConnect](https://skyconnect.home-assistant.io/procedures/enable-thread/)
  - [Enabling Thread on Yellow](https://yellow.home-assistant.io/procedures/enable-thread/)
- You have an Android phone and the Home Assistant Companion App. (Note: this does not work with the iOS Companion App).
- The devices you want to add to the network support {% term Matter %}. For instructions on how to add Thread-based {% term Matter %} devices, refer to the section [Adding a Matter device to Home Assistant](/integrations/matter/#adding-a-matter-device-to-home-assistant)

Which TBRs are supported mostly depends on (access to) the Thread credentials. And Thread credentials are required during on-boarding/commissioning, which is part of the smart home protocol.

### Combining Thread networks

In the current implementation, having multiple <abbr title="Thread border routers">TBRs</abbr> from different vendors results in separate networks using different credentials. This prevents devices from roaming between the Thread networks. In theory, it would be better to join all Thread networks into a single network to increase the size of the mesh network. A dense mesh network should lead to better <abbr title="radio frequency">RF</abbr> coverage and better link quality, which lowers transmission latencies, making communication faster.

<div class="warning">

Currently, combining Thread networks seems to lead to instabilities. Therefore, we do not recommend combining networks in production just yet. This is especially true for our OpenThread Border Router in combination with Google or Apple Thread networks.
